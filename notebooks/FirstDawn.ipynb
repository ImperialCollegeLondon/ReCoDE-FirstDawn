    "The history of the Universe can be split into several phases. It 'started'[<sup id=\"fn1-back\">1</sup>](#fn1) with the big bang, followed by the period of cosmic inflation. This created fundamental particles, and from the resulting asymmetry between matter and antimatter, the quark-gluon plasma formed. As the primordial quark-gluon plasma cooled, protons and neutrons formed. The energy released from baryon formation and other processes led to an abundance of photons at this time. This period is known the radiation dominated era. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the Universe cooled even more, it transitioned into the matter dominated era, at $z \\approx 3300$. At $z \\approx 1100$ (100 000 years after the Big Bang), the Universe was cool enough for electrons to recombine with protons to form neutral hydrogen -- which then combined to form the lighter elements (known as recombination). This led to photons' decoupling from baryons, creating what we now observe as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the formation of the CMB, the Universe went through what's known as the dark ages; this is when the Universe was made primarily of neutral gasses, and no stars. As the universe cooled even more, these neutral gasses started to collapse and create the first stars and galaxies. These first stars (called population III stars) flooded the surrounding gas with ionising photons. This period in the Universe's history is known as the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). As more stars and galaxies formed, the entire inter-stellar medium became ionised again. The evolution of the Universe's history is shown in the sketch below:\n",

    "An open problem in EoR research is how best to constrain the reionization history using 21 cm intensity measurements. One common approach is to use summary statistics such as the power spectrum[<sup id=\"fn2-back\">2</sup>](#fn2). Fully Bayesian parameter inference methods  have been developed for this task[<sup id=\"fn3-back\">3</sup>](#fn3). However, the 21~cm signal from the EoR is expected to be non-Gaussian, implying that there is significant information encoded in higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum[<sup id=\"fn4-back\">4</sup>](#fn4). But all such summaries still entail some loss of information. The Square Kilometer Array(SKA)[<sup id=\"fn5-back\">5</sup>](#fn5) will produce tomography throughout the EoR, allowing the possibility of inferring parameters from the maps themselves. However, the amount of data and large parameter space pose significant challenges for traditional statistical inference methods, and instead the problem necessitates the deployment of machine learning methods.\n",

    "The SKA will only come online at the end of the decade, hence the this tomographical data does not exist yet. In order to prepare for the deluge of data that will come from this next generation telescope, we need to create mock data to train machine learning models and create data analysis pipelines. One method to create this mock data is to use semi-numerical simulations. In this tutorial we will be using `SimFast21` [<sup id=\"fn6-back\">6</sup>](#fn6). Okay but what are we actually simulating? Well, the SKA will be observing the 21 cm emmision line that comes from neutral hydrogen and hence it will be able to probe the hydrogen gas clouds during the EoR. The general idea is that when the first stars and galaxies were formed, they started to ionise the surrounding gas. So what we should see is small bubbles of ionised gas start to form around the stars and galaxies. As time goes on, these bubbles will grow and start to overlap, eventually leading to all the hydrogen in the universe becoming ionised. An example simulation is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alternative text](figures/simfast21.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By studying how these bubbles form, change and grow we can infer a lot about the underlying physics that drives it. One of the easiest measurements one can make is called the ionisation fraction($x_{HI} $), This is the fraction of ionised hydrogen present in a volume. This is the parameter we will be attempting to infer from our simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so with all that background out of the way, we can finally get back to some machine learning. The first thing we will need is some data. You're welcome to clone the `SimFast21` github page[<sup id=\"fn7-back\">7</sup>](#fn7) and simulate the data we will be using for yourself, however if this sounds too intimidating at the moment then we can just download a pre-simulated dataset here. \n",
